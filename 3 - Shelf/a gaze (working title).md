scholomance story idea
- wizards, for various reasons, live ~among mundanes 
- wizards have to avoid magic around mundanes
	- wizards have to *hide parts of themselves* from mundane world
- magic that modifies the body has to turn it "normal" to avoid clashing with consensus reality, including the **mundane gaze**
	- remember this being mentioned in canon? ask someone later
	- [ ] check
	- magic that works with biology is much, much harder
	- magic that makes the body strange is incompatible with the typical wizard lifestyle
		- some wizards are atypical

if you don't know me this is a metaphor for queerness. with that out of the way, i've always been a sucker for *transformation* stories. coming-of-age is okay, sometimes, but i tend to find the ideas behind some coming of age stories underwhelming, and the whole child-to-adult (cta... transage) thing can strike me as a little off the mark, as someone who has a lot of weird associations with maturity. turning into an adult is reaching out for help and finding... nothing, a conspicuous, surprising emptiness, and understanding that the other adults can't help you any more than you could help a friend, and that they're lost, too, and nothing stops you from being better or worse than them on your own merits. it's shedding their weight on you, severing your umbilical cord or ripping it out, with bloody claws or a flaming sword, or, for the lucky ones, just popping out, like another newborn, ready to meet the world with your own eyes. it's taking off a veil and seeing the world for what it is. many children, i think, already know this, but it find it difficult to act upon. some people never really learn it. 

coming of age stories often teach lessons the adults might not really want to teach you, not *really*. my greatest aspiration is to teach a lesson the humans don't want to teach you.

"a gaze" refers to the way a look can pin you down, how someone else's presence can restrain you. i want to write a story about being strange even after retreating into your little slice of the world, of diverging, of inhabiting an impossible piece of a dream and thriving in it, of fighting a losing battle with reality that's worth dying for just to be in
