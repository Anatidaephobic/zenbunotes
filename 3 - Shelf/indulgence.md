An angel is a promise.

The nature of the celestial order ensures that all miracles are granted with direct, divine, and specific purpose. It would be blasphemous and imprecise to say that a human can compel the order; the order is the design in heaven, the design is the right, and the right is the divine absolute. All an earthen creature can do is act in accordance with that design. The divine proceeds always in the right; therefore, to call upon the divine, proceedings must be in all ways deserving of a miracle. And as an angel comes to carry out the divine will, the intentions, absolute and particular, are to fulfil a promise. The angel's presence is **just**; it could not be otherwise.

The operational implication of this is simply that the magnitude of the future metaphysical possibility of promise-fulfilment must meet a function of its moral urgency to be met with a correspondingly task-appropriate miracle, as elaborated in the Valefar-Tarski theorem. And since the world is not divine alone, the justifiability of a divine promise is not sufficient for the likely fulfilment of its final cause; epistemically justifiable predictions based on the impurity of the world may themselves be abominable to divinity. This means events can be engineered such that not only moral urgency meets any desired threshold, metaphysical possibility is maximally divorced from expected probability. Historical organized attempts to produce bound angels were necessarily unreliable and implied repeated costly failures; modern ARCOM archivists uncovered a set of secret early scholastic texts arguing with precision the ways in which binding an angel could be the highest offense against the Holy Spirit, revealing useful techniques by consequence.

The promises of the Light can be corrupted and broken. 

In gracing the earth with Tzuriel, Guardian of Temperance, the heavens promised to liberate a deeply pious man from being forcefully overfed and ritually consumed by a group of demonic cultists. He stepped out amid a prayer from a beam cast through glass by the lunar lights, and instantly liberated every human present of the temptation and mind-fog of desire; a handful immediately killed themselves, others fell into a weeping frenzy, and a select few were never blind to true evil and raised their daggers to fight back. Tzuriel set about slaughtering them, throwing furniture and snapping necks with unnatural calm, for though he knew divine wrath from scripture, he did not participate in it directly, for he was an exemplar of temperance alone and perfect in this respect to the exclusion of others.

The last survivor among the devil-sighted cultists grabbed a young child and held his knife to its throat, and the angel, perhaps lacking in locally appropriate wrath and decisiveness, did not prevent it. And the angel said, so shall be it, and separated mechanically the mortal sinner's skull from his spine, moving with grace and calm to tend to the child's wounds by pressure and the feeding of his sacred blood by the child's mouth, the angel that could never be moved to tears, and so could never cry on a wound so that it may be healed. 

As it happens, the child was a strange thing, free of sin but with something ugly sharing its body, a gluttonous devil that demanded they eat the angel whole, and promised great power for it. The angel knew this from the start; it was what allowed him to heal by feeding the child his blood. But the child was baptised, innocent, and somewhat pious; the sinful desire was not only no fault of her own, but also not her own. She had every right, and some potential inclination, to experience the call of sin and refuse it. She was deserving of that chance, and the angel freely gave it with no possibility of regret.

But it was, reasonably speaking, rather unlikely.

The ARCOM containment team isolated the chamber and declared the operation a likely success. This, too, the angel knew from the start.

Eating an angel is a contradiction. An angel's body is quintessentially holy; partaking in it must also be partaking in the divine. But while human consumption of angel flesh is not cannibalism, it is most plainly an abomination, symbolizing at best the desecration of a righteously fallen corpse left in the accomplishment of a worthy cause, and at worst an exaltation of a broken promise by the divine. It has been done; the result is generally a supernal abomination that quickly expires, not metaphysically coherent enough to endure its own anathema.

Gluttonously devouring the still living body of an angel of temperance is a much deeper contradiction, of a kind entirely its own.

"What did it taste like?"

I thwack my lips, tasting the impression of a memory burned eternally in my mind. I trill and sing, uniquely supernal voicebox carrying a harmony like the twinkling stars, ringing crystal and birdsong.

"Indulgent."

"That isn't very helpful."

I frown at my strange friend, and search for more words. 

"Imagine the most beautiful person you've ever met."

She smiles at me mysteriously and I poke out my tongue at her. I continue.

"Imagine them feeding you your favorite food. Hands tickling your lips like cold velvet in the scorching heat, that feeling spreading across your body, paralyzing you in ecstasy. Imagine the hand slowly reaching into your mouth, the taste deepening with every inch, felt in places that shouldn't be able to taste at all. All a gift, all something granted freely to you, even as you're the one who eats it. And suddenly the arm starts going down your throat and into your stomach, and you feel everything all the way, until it's everything you feel, everything you know and think, until it makes you feel full, like you've eaten past your fill... but the arm doesn't stop, it keeps going in, forever, and feeling full starts feeling good, and starts feeling like being bigger than you are. Bigger and bigger. Maybe as big as the world. And it doesn't stop, for an eternity, until it does, and you realize you've bitten off the head of the most beautiful person in the world. But the regret never comes. You're just satisfied. Perfectly."

I pay attention to her again, and she's nodding.

"So, not like chi-"

"No, not like chicken."

We smile.
