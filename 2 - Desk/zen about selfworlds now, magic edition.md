>In the beginning, there was the earth. The First One blinked awake from an ore and clawed its way out of the rock, bursting out of the earth with newborn hunger. Its head was as tall as the mountains; its body raked into the earth and left it scarred; its claws bore ravines and the rubble shaped hills. It dug into the earth desperately, making mountains of the pieces it tossed aside, and found gemstones. It broke its teeth on the largest, clearest diamond of the earth, as large as its colossal hand; it screamed so loudly it shattered stones into sand and scattered it across the deserts; it rolled and shook across the earth, pressing the oceans depths in large indents and fusing the rocks to the ground. Its thrashing opened its wounds further, and it quickly bled to death.

>All superstition, of course. Geological research gives us little reason to believe any large amount of the surface of the earth was shaped by anything other than tectonic and erosive action--we have a good grasp of the processes and the timeline over which they occurred. And geobiological research on the Origin Entity likewise gives us no reason to believe it ever had anything like limbs or claws; its conserved bones give the impression that it was something more like a whale than a biped, which makes sense, given that it very likely required a thick hull and rounded shape to withstand the hazards of outer space. It's also likely there was some amount of water already on Libera before its arrival...

My earliest memory is one of torture.

Many like to entertain fanciful notions about the wombs; the creatures unfortunate enough to remember something of their birth generally enjoy some degree of retrospective or neonatal cognitive distortion. If I had to guess, adult sophont-typical thinking patterns just aren't meant to grasp... the free-for-all of the Ovum, the bondage of the womb, the sharp, sudden, painful transition between the two. Sharp, zero-knowledge decision making is what gets you out of the red zone alive about a third of the time, whereas writhing in confusion and trying to make sense of it works approximately none of the time.

But yes. Torture. The womb was not peaceful, but a small bubble where I drowned and forced the breaths that eventually would build the strength I would need to purge the fluids from my lungs when the time came to replace it with air. My first bowel movements, too, were in there; the less said about that the better. I was an incomplete thing. A thing being forged, unstable, growing nowhere near the environment my adult form would eventually adapt to, but which would also die outside the graces of the womb. A half-forsaken thing that had no justifiable use for the tranquility which would be my adult resting state. Cruelly self-aware in a gambit that might much later pay off.

And then came the rest of my life. The amyotic sac burst, and I fell kicking and screaming into the grass. I rended my own skin on accident; I was born with particularly sharp claws, and I suppose that was what made me realize living was "serious", in a sense, that I had to pay attention to what was happening so I wouldn't get hurt, now that my senses could grasp a narrow distinction between pleasant and unpleasant directions of stimuli. I know many newborns keep screaming, I heard them, but I think that sudden awareness of being one among others was why I survived.

So I ran, away from the screaming, away from the blood-red vines and the writhing tissue.
