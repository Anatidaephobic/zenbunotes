>In the beginning, there was the earth. The First One blinked awake from an ore and clawed its way out of the rock, bursting out of the earth with newborn hunger. Its head was as tall as the mountains; its body raked into the earth and left it scarred; its claws bore ravines and the rubble shaped hills. It dug into the earth desperately, making mountains of the pieces it tossed aside, and found gemstones. It broke its teeth on the largest, clearest diamond of the earth, as large as its colossal hand; it screamed so loudly it shattered stones into sand and scattered it across the deserts; it rolled and shook across the earth, pressing the oceans depths in large indents and fusing the rocks to the ground. Its thrashing opened its wounds further, and it quickly bled to death.

>Droll and blood settled into the oceans, and from the separated fluids and the rot became the water and life of all the earth.

>All superstition, of course. Geological research gives us little reason to believe any large amount of the surface of the earth was shaped by anything other than tectonic and erosive action--we have a good grasp of the processes and the timeline over which they occurred. And geobiological research on the Origin Entity likewise gives us no reason to believe it ever had anything like limbs or claws; its conserved bones give the impression that it was something more like a whale than a biped, which makes sense, given that it had to be very large and rounded to withstand the hazards of outer space. It's also likely there was some amount of water already on Libera before its arrival...

My first conscious minute alive was peaceful. The world was faint pink light, a strange tingling, and the occasional contortion; it all surrounded me, diffuse, no particular reason to separate sense data into a world-view. It was only a minute, I think, but I do dream of it sometimes; when I dream of it, it feels like it stretches on forever in both directions, and I'm suspended fully in that peaceful feeling. Stasis.

And then came the rest of my life. The amyotic sac burst, and I fell kicking and screaming into the grass. I rended my own skin on accident; I was born with particularly sharp claws, and that was what made me realize living was "serious", in a sense, that I had to pay attention to what was happening so I wouldn't get hurt. I know many newborns keep screaming, I heard them, but I think that was why I survived.
