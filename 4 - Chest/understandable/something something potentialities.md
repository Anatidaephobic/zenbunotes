okay so i got confused by this, tried wikipedia to learn what "transitivity" and "apposition" were, got frustrated because the articles aren't good, finally learned/remembered what the words meant, found this book, got more confused, found an interview, sort of got it, went back to the book, realized i didn't get it, looked up the essay the concept is from, and finally got it 

my experience is that most academic introductions suck incredibly if you aren't already thoroughly acquainted with the concepts in discussion and are just sort of a refresher and primer on how you're going to relate the concepts in use; basically it sucks at being an introduction and i always skip it after skimming for key concepts i can check if i know about

Colebrook is doing the thing where you take a word, and you draw its different and component meanings and do a bunch of philosophy on them and then smash them together into a composite superconcept where it's difficult to really explain the whole thing instead of starting to explain different things from different directions leading into a single thing, but

basically what Colebrook is getting at in *What Is It Like To Be a Human* is that being-whatever (human, a man, transgender, etc) is a process of emerging from a singularity of unorganized stuff that then stabilizes itself by "differentiating" itself from other things, relating to them in an open field where there aren't really any shapes for you to adopt or instantiate, or "ground to rest on"; it tells a cognitive-linguistic story where establishing an identity is to a great extent about saying "i am not this, i am not that", resting on other objects, simultaneously *deferring what you are* to them, building up your complexity by richly differing from other things through--eg--sex and race differentiation.

"transitivity" means "the capacity of holding others as objects" but also "of being the same", and contains "across" or "beyond"; here it means a process of creating sameness, of *creating a subject* by holding other things as objects, and the primordial chaos (the "trans") that exists before that, of existing level with everything else, in the same plane, undifferentiated and incoherent

Colebrook's perspective is that it's important, when considering things like "the difference between men and women" to *step back into the transitive* and find instability instead of just holding the current categories as stable and charting out how they relate, because that would miss the fundamental-to-reality step of the differentiation that gives rise to these categories, which serves as evidence of the irreducible complexity of the individual objects which (we) compose (into) categories 

this is sort of "things are socially constructed" but done in a way that i think is actually pretty analytically cool. the "differentiation" stuff is from deleuze and derrida who she cites in her paper and who are basically necessary to understand what the hell she is on about. it is a complicated-ass paper but i thought that was interesting
