>In the beginning, before the earth had separated into layers, there was the body. The body became from ore, and broke free from its geode egg with a newborn's hunger. Its head was as tall as the mountains; in waking convulsions, the body raked into the earth and left it scarred. The body's claws bore ravines and the rubble shaped hills. It dug into the earth desperately, making mountains of the pieces it tossed aside, and found gemstones. They excited the body, for it could not shine as they did. In its perfect innocence, the body sought perfection, and broke its teeth on the largest, clearest diamond of the earth, as large as its colossal hand; it screamed so as to shatter stones into sand and scatter it across the deserts; it rolled and shook across the earth, pressing the oceans depths in long sweeps and fusing the rocks to the ground. It thrashed, opening its wounds further, and bled to death.

>Droll and blood settled into the oceans, and from the separated fluids and the rot became the water and life of all the earth.

>All superstition, of course. Geological research gives us little reason to believe any large amount of the surface of the earth was shaped by anything other than tectonic and erosive action--we have a good grasp of the processes and the timeline over which they occurred. And geobiological research on the Origin Entity likewise gives us no reason to believe it ever had anything like limbs or claws; its conserved bones give the impression that it was something more like a whale than a biped, which makes sense, given that it very likely required a thick hull and rounded shape to withstand the hazards of outer space. It's also likely there was some amount of water already on Libera before its arrival...

My earliest memory is of eating shit.

Sophonts like to entertain fanciful notions about the wombs; the creatures unfortunate enough to remember something of their birth generally enjoy a little bit of retrospective cognitive distortion. If I had to guess, adult minds just aren't adapted for... the free-for-all of the Ovum, the bondage of the womb, the sharp, sudden, painful transition between the two. Prompt, zero-knowledge decision making is what gets you out of the red zone alive about a third of the time, whereas writhing in confusion and trying to make sense of it works approximately none of the time. There is a gap which must widen as they grow, if they are to evolve into capable, civilized learners, which is filled with stories.

But yes. Shit. The womb was not peaceful. A body made for air cannot be content with water. The breaths that eventually would build the strength I would eventually need to expel the water of the womb were agony. My first bowel movements brought them context; cadence and structure, a "this" that was "there", a "before" and an "after". Something to recall. I was an incomplete thing. A hot iron in the forge, unstable, growing nowhere near the environment my adult form would eventually adapt to, but which would also die outside the graces of the womb. A half-forsaken thing that had no justifiable use for the tranquility which would be my adult resting state. Cruelly self-aware in a gambit that might much later pay off.

And then came the rest of my life. The amyotic sac burst, and I fell kicking and screaming into the grass. I rended my own skin on accident; I was born with particularly sharp claws, and I think that was what made me realize living was "serious", in a sense. That I had to pay attention to what was happening, so I wouldn't get hurt, now that my senses could grasp a narrow distinction between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. I know many newborns keep screaming, I heard them, but I think that sudden awareness of myself was why I survived.

So I ran, away from the screaming, away from the blood-red vines and the writhing tissue.
