My arms hurt. My heart beats a little too fast. I'm breathing in and out like I'm trying not to die, and I realize it's true, that I'm fighting for my life, that I'm ripping the oxygen out of the air so I can exist. I reach out from the darkness around my eyes and expand until I'm more awake than awake, stewing in the hurt and the tired and the panic and the burn, cooking my brain, stewing in chemical soup until I'm-  
  
Two beeps.  
  
My focus breaks. I notice I feel like puking so I don't, I start to slow down my breathing, stare at the wall, sit up. I know enough to understand that reaching for all the pieces of enlightenment might make them go away faster, so I just reflect a bit, reaching for my tin of flash cards and pulling a pen out of my pocket. My limbs feel heavy and numb, but I'm used to it. A foot reaches for my PDA and pulls it closer, but I don't look at it yet. I try to put just enough words on each card so I'll be able to know what to look for next time, what revelations to develop. I let some word soup spill out onto one of the cards until there's no more space, and I don't try to write smaller, I just drop the pen and the card on the floor and look at the message. Skull pressure released.  
  
Two beeps means a personal message. I don't know that like I know the kinks on my favorite pen or lover, I know that like I know the number of legs on a human or balls in a sack. Not a universal truth, but a very, very persistent fixture, something that's terribly interesting when it isn't true. You know when someone has to look at their device, and you know when someone really has to look at their device. This one isn't urgent, but someone is reaching out to me. I want to reach back. *Click*. I read the message.   
  
`bwoo`  
  
I type out and almost finish sending `am i being freaking trolled¿?¿?¿?` but stop, staring at the message. Not in my contacts, and I don't recognize the username, “hans”, but the message tickles me, it's on the tip of my tongue, but sometimes things tickle me from the future, not the past. Generally that feeling means I still have something to squeeze out of my skull.  
  
I reflexively check my notes, *click click*, and search for “bwoo” to no hits. “bwo”, “bwo#”, still nothing. No “hans” either, even with some wildcards. I close my eyes and think. I close my eyes and type.  
  
When I come to my senses I've already written thirty lines of fucked-up text, the predictive keyboard barely able to keep up with my slips. It's a rambling disorganized mess about meat and organs that I can barely keep up with on the word-to-word level now that I've put it down, but I get it, now that I look at it, it really makes sense, and I notice I'm crying, and that I'm tired and empty in a way no amount of exercise can make me, and that I've finally squeezed my skull empty, because I don't feel tickled at all, just done, and that I've already pressed send.

The typing indicator only takes a few seconds to pop up, and then disappear, and then pop up again, and when the message comes I know we've touched.

`do you want to be my twin`

Zenii are liquid routed around rocks that keep getting pushed around by the flow. It's difficult for a Zen to answer questions like “what am I” in a very profound way. If you try to ask, they might explode lyrical or try to play games, but they won't have a very serious answer. In Zenguage there is a word somewhere between “being” and “becoming”, and it's a thing you do, not a thing you are. Zenii sometimes feel something like identity, but it often melts between their fingers under inspection. Zenii are more interested in ways. Ways of thinking, ways of living and seeing and doing. They have a keen sense that they don't know anything about themselves; Zenii frequently feel like they don't know where their thoughts come from. Instead, they try to build up an expertise of themselves as if they were someone else, keeping heavily annotated comprehensive records of their lives in a sort of self-ethnography.

Maybe because of this, they have difficulty taking themselves seriously and can have large chunks of their ways change at the drop of a hat. Zenii typically dedicate long stretches of their lives to “chasing” a feeling, concept, or subject, exploring its limits and developing it in a way very similar to fandom. Zenii are flighty and have difficulty finishing very long tasks on their own, so they often come together into so-called “assemblages” where they mutually engage each other in a topic to stop themselves from drifting. Zenii naturally drift from one pursuit to another, leaving a thick paper trail on their way that they can use to try to access previous states of mind.

Zenii also tend to drift in their social relationships. Because their interests and personalities change quickly, friend groups tend to diverge without constant maintenance. They rarely “miss” people very strongly, but tend to respond to sudden feelings of wanting to be around someone by checking their notes and immediately calling that person to talk or meet, even after entire years or decades without contact, and giddily discuss past loves with ample reference material. Bad relationships tend to break up quickly, especially since Zenii respond to rejection by withdrawal. 

Zen life is generally designed around “staying on the move”. This can mean frictionless software, efficient transport, convenient and airy clothing for running everywhere… or, maybe counter-intuitively, it can mean eschewing more efficient modes of travel like elevators for stairs and fitting fidget/exercise contraptions into every single space, including offices, which are traditionally made to be accessed by climbing a jungle gym, with stairs and elevators for emergencies. It's common for Zenii on queues to start doing push-ups or stretches. Mental work is almost always done while somewhat physically spent, and it's traditional to start the day by warming up and running outside. People in conditions that don't allow them to make use of traditional entry methods will often ask to be carried through them, which many Zenii consider a welcome diversion.

Zenii are fascinated by personal preparation, and tend to overthink many parts of day to day life. They have a vibrant everyday carry sector, and most carry some kind of satchel or backpack, with utility belts and pouches common for work roles, including white collar work. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507574180988977189/564268344228970520/DyFSgdeUwAIJP1b.png)
Zenii heavily value something that's regularly referred to in their philosophy as “the incommunicable”. The incommunicable is that which, no matter how much you try to explain it, can only be found in someone else, not transmitted. They value the sensation of interlocking their thoughts with the outside world, and often feel a longing for a mutual understanding that they can't quite find with most people no matter how hard they try, at least in some spheres of thought. Zenii are extremely vocal about their thoughts, and generally build their life-notes so other people can read them. They keep very few secrets, and don't mind sharing strange or antisocial thoughts they have; thoughts are mainly understood to be under the influence of something which includes but is larger than what they consider “the person”. Two or more Zenii will sometimes find each other extremely relatable and converge into semi-permanent assemblages. These often result in one or multiple pregnancies when there is reproductive compatibility, but are very distinct from normal reproductive partnership, which is typically a state-remunerated affair between a donor, caretaker, and incubator, since Zenii tend to be highly aversive to pregnancy. 

What Zenii lack in mental stability, they make up for in the stability of their surroundings. Because Zenii are flighty and prone to distractions or hyperfocus, they employ various context-manipulation measures to keep themselves on track outside of assemblage-projects. These can range from compulsively checking a notebook, writing on their hands, and setting reminders, to actively precommitting to schedules by restriction and punishment. Zenii tend to be on a spectrum between intuitionists, who prefer to set light reminders and "follow their gut" for most of the day, mostly relying on social pressure for serious projejcts, and disciplinarians, who set rigid schedules, often hard-locked by some means, and enter into associations where they punish each other for
