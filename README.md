# zenbunotes
This is a "personal" public notebook that I'm maintaining as a personal knowledge base and a place to share short text segments. I'm open to use of all github features as ways to annotate, comment on and generally discourse around those notes, though I can't really promise I'm super eager to take a bunch of edits and critique to my personal notes, since to me part of the point of putting down notes is registering the actual thoughts I had about something at the time. If someone wants to use anything I've said here, I'd like to be cited if at all possible.
