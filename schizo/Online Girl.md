No one on this earth is more online than I.

I wear a pair of e-glasses. The right lens is hooked directly to the Twitter Firehose API. I see each and every tweet the instant it touches the Web. My left eye parses discord channels and blogs, weaving and deciphering patterns in the memeways. Posts course through me like currents in the ocean. They bring me fish, sharks, great whales, rotting carcasses. I dream of a great behemoth of pipes and wires. Bowels. Veins. It groans. I see God in between the trollface's teeth.

I reach into my fridge. I'm out of tendies. The flesh quivers. I do not stop posting. My hands grasp cloth, metal, and my legs bring me outside, light filling my peripheral vision. I do not stop posting.

A liminality grasps my attention. A post, but one behind the screens, beyond them, waving with the motion of my skull. A girl wearing a VR headset, with a small camera at the center. She looks at me.

"Google Glass," she remarks. "ùõº-cheugy, overmuch?"

I post through my teeth, bitter. "That's a psyop."

She smiles a meme face that has not been born. I shiver.

"Not for long." 

I fall for her.
