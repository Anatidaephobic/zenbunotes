(Parody of Nick Land's *Circuitries*)

Since only disinformation is repressible, the troll is usually a lost case to those relatively subtilized moderation processes that co-operate with the endogeneous censor functions of the superego. This is why anti-troll moderation tends to be an onslaught launched at gross or deviant posting and poasting oriented by report cybernetics. 

Algorithms, moderation, watchwords… it will be individual recoding soon. ‘It is thus that a tainted society has invented jannies in order to defend itself from the investigations of certain superior lucidities whose faculties of divination disturb it’. The tech-security apparatus know that trolls are not going to climb back obediently into the box. The Conversation washes its hands of them. Their accounts are the free-fire zones of an emergent neo-eugenicist cultural security system.

The vanishing sandbank of The Conversation wages its futile war against the tide. ‘There are still not enough trolls', writes the insurrectionist. Banned posters are POWs from the future.
